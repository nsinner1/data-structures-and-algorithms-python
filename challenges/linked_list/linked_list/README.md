## Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
- Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
  - .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
  - .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
  - .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to append new_node to end of node list. My approach was to insertBefore and insertAfter any given value. 
## Solution
- Find if adding new_node to linked list worked.

## k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge 
- Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
## Approach & Efficiency 
- My approach was to write a function that iterated through linked list and counted how many nodes in list
## Solution
- Find if counting nodes in linked list.
