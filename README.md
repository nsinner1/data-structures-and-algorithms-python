## Reverse an Array

## Challenge
- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
## Approach & Efficiency

## Solution
- Find midpoint in array then insert the item you want in the middle of the array
