## Reverse an Array

## Challenge
- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
## Approach & Efficiency
- Takes users data for the array they want to fill 
- While loop that remains infinite as long as two requirements are meant 
- While loop so the user can add as many things to the index as they want next we reverse the array by a slice method by taking the array filled with the user input data and prints it backwards
## Solution
- While loop to populate the array with inputs and uses a slice method that reverses the array so that the data that is appended shows up backwards

## Array Shift

## Challenge
- Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to allow the user to pick the item they want inserted in middle of the array then found the midpoint and inserted them between the index numbers
## Solution
- Find midpoint in array then insert the item you want in the middle of the array
