## Reverse an Array

## Challenge
- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
## Approach & Efficiency
- Takes users data for the array they want to fill 
- While loop that remains infinite as long as two requirements are meant 
- While loop so the user can add as many things to the index as they want next we reverse the array by a slice method by taking the array filled with the user input data and prints it backwards
## Solution
- While loop to populate the array with inputs and uses a slice method that reverses the array so that the data that is appended shows up backwards

## Array Shift

## Challenge
- Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to allow the user to pick the item they want inserted in middle of the array then found the midpoint and inserted them between the index numbers
## Solution
- Find midpoint in array then insert the item you want in the middle of the array

## Array Binary Search

## Challenge
- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to allow the user to pick a number and be able to tell if that number was in the array by showing a 2 if it was and a -1 if it was not. 
## Solution
- Find if user picked number that was in array by showing 2 if it is and -1 if it is not.

# Singly Linked List

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Approach & Efficiency
I followed the demo code and worked off of that. 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

# Merge two linked lists
- Merge teo linked list together. 

## Challenge Description
- Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to merge two linked list together to create one new linked list. Time = O(n); space = O(n)
